# TODO_APP
Flutter Todo App with Hive Storage

Description:
This Flutter-based todo app provides a clean and intuitive interface for managing daily tasks. It leverages Hive, a lightweight and fast NoSQL database, for efficient local data storage. The app allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) todo items seamlessly.

Key Features:

1. Task Creation: Users can add new tasks with a title and optional description.
2. Task Listing: Displays all tasks in a scrollable list, showing the title and completion status.
3. Task Completion: Users can mark tasks as complete or incomplete with a simple tap.
4. Task Editing: Allows users to modify the title or description of existing tasks.
5. Task Deletion: Provides the ability to remove tasks from the list.
6. Persistent Storage: Uses Hive to store tasks locally, ensuring data persists between app sessions.


Technical Implementation:

1. State Management: Utilizes the Provider package for efficient state management across the app.
2. Local Database: Implements Hive for fast, key-value pair storage of todo items.
3. Hive Adapters: Custom Hive adapters are used to serialize and deserialize Todo objects.
4. CRUD Operations: All CRUD operations are performed using Hive boxes, ensuring quick data access and updates.
5. UI Components: Employs Flutter's material design widgets for a cohesive and responsive user interface.


App Structure:

1. Models:

1. Todo: Represents a todo item with properties like id, title, description, and isCompleted.



2. Screens:

1. HomeScreen: Displays the list of todos and provides options to add new tasks.
2. AddTodoScreen: Allows users to create new todo items.
3. EditTodoScreen: Enables users to modify existing todo items.



3. Widgets:

1. TodoListItem: A custom widget to display individual todo items in the list.
2. TodoForm: A reusable form for adding and editing todos.



4. Services:

1. HiveService: Manages all interactions with the Hive database, including CRUD operations for todos.



5. Providers:

1. TodoProvider: Manages the state of todos and communicates with the HiveService to perform data operations.





Data Flow:

1. When the app starts, it initializes Hive and opens the todo box.
2. The TodoProvider loads all todos from Hive and notifies its listeners.
3. User actions (add, edit, delete) are handled by the TodoProvider.
4. The TodoProvider updates the Hive database and the app's state.
5. UI components listen to the TodoProvider and rebuild when the todo list changes.


This Flutter todo app with Hive implementation offers a smooth, responsive user experience while ensuring efficient local data storage. The use of Hive allows for quick data access and updates, making the app performant even with a large number of todos.
